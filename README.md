# `bing-os` (Bingo's OS)

TLDR
- Forked / built on top of Universal Blue (https://github.com/ublue-os/startingpoint).
- Taking cues from Bluefin (https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin), though slimmed down for Brian's use cases.
- Built specifically for Brian's portable development setup. Not guaranteed to work beyond his set of devices.
